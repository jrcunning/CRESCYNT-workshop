## So excited to make some ggplots!
```{r}
my_plot <- ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
  
my_plot + geom_point(alpha = 0.4)
```

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.4)
# Can add the aes color to either the main ggplot call or the geom_point call
```

Make a scatterplot of `hwy` vs `cty` mileage with different colors representing each car `class` and different shapes for each fuel type (`fl`).
```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(y = hwy, x = cty, shape = fl, color = class)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.4)
# aes call expects names of columns (unquoted) in your data frame, NOT quoted strings...
```
